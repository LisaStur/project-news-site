Project News Site for Technigo Boot Camp

This is a project to learn and practice Flexbox and responsive web pages, using HTML and CSS.

After a messy first attempt I started over, this time wiht a basic plan of what I wanted the site to look like in the various screen-sizes. First using Flexbox to set the different structures, then adding the content and styling it in CSS.
After making a first version, I spent some time on creating hover-effects on some of the links (and tidying up the HTML-file).
