      <h2>King of the Jungle</h2>
      <p>
        One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in
        sculptures and paintings, on national flags and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in
        menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological
        gardens across the word since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in the Upper
        Paleolithic period, carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves in France have been dated to 17
        000 years ago. Depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures that coincided with the
        lionâ€™s former and current ranges.
